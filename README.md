===========

The goal of this project is to convert an AirSwimmer (http://www.airswimmers.com) helium balloon fish into to be controllable over a network. This is done by replacing the analog wireless control module with a n RFM12B wireless module controlled by an Atmega328 microcontroller. A base station in the form of a Nanode networked Arduino clone acts as a gateway between the RFM12B connection and the network. It provides a REST-like interface which can be used to control the AirSwimmer.
